crab: A Cucumber-Rally bridge
=============================

`crab` bridges the gap between stories specified, managed and tracked in
[Rally][1] and stories that are described and run as automated acceptance
and functional tests through [Cucumber][2].

It aims to provide seamless integration between both tools, allowing
people to communicate across these without much effort while trying to
stay out of the way as much as possible.

Installing
----------

`crab` is distributed as a Ruby Gem. To install it, simply issue:

    gem install crab

And you should be good to go. To make sure everything is ok, try:

    crab -h

If you see a help message, everything went fine.

Usage
-----

As `crab` is still in its infancy, it doesn't support very complex
workflows, but does the job for the author and his team so far.

The team wrote a few stories directly in Rally before deciding that
writing them straight in Cucumber features would be better suited.
Initially, there were concerns around migration of the existing data.
Thankfully, that part is easy:

    # crab login -u cv@lixo.org -p mypassword
    Logged in as cv@lixo.org.

    # crab project "World Domination 3000"
    # crab list
    US1001: Arms Rockets Upon Successful Boot
    US1002: Launches Rockets Upon Command from Evil Mastermind
    US1003: Transfer $0.01 From All Bank Accounts
    ...

    # crab find Rockets
    US1001: Arms Rockets Upon Successful Boot
    US1002: Launches Rockets Upon Command from Evil Mastermind

    # crab show US1001
    Feature: [US1001] Arms Rockets After Boot

      In order to gain bargaining power with Super Hero
      As an Evil Mastermind
      Wants visible evidence that the rockets have been armed

      ...

If there are any test cases, their steps get converted into Cucumber
steps:

    # crab show US1001
      ...

      Scenario: [TC10001] Rocket Silo Is Unlocked
        Given a silo where the rockets are stored
        When I boot the system
        The hatches should unlock

      ...

Some data about stories can also be edited straight from the command line.
In that sense, `crab` acts more like a CLI interface to Rally than a bridge
between Rally and Cucumber, but the team thought these were *very* convenient
features to have:

    # crab update US1001 --name "Arms Rockets Upon Successful Boot" --state completed

There are more switches. Check out `crab update --help` to find out more.

To do
-----

- Add a `push` subcommand which parses a Cucumber feature and adds or updates it in Rally
- Add a way to create, edit and delete test cases / scenarios from the command line
- `pull` is not very smart and could detect feature files being moved from one dir to another
- Recursively look for a `.rally_project` file like Git does with `.git` dirs
- Encrypt password in generated `~/.rally_credentials`
- Verbose logging (especially before any change or destructive operations in Rally)
- Dry-run mode
- Figure out how to stub or simulate Rally (tests are taking way too long already)
